# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network (Python, Machine Learning)
Uses a 3 layer Perceptron Neural Network with feature reduction to identify the correct class labels for each image of handwritten digits.  
Training set: 50K images, Validation and Test set: 10K images  

This needs a copy of the MNIST dataset (mnist_all.mat) to run.
